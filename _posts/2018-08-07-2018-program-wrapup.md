Congratulations to our 75 graduates!

The Second Global Code Summer Program closed today in Koforidua, Accra and Cape Coast. 75 students were taught by 13 volunteers over 3 weeks: Linux, Python programming, MQTT, electronics – with a bit of databases and Docker thrown in for good measure.


We’re all enormously proud of our students. Ghanaian men and women who have given up three weeks of their holidays to work with us, learn from us, and welcome us to their country. It’s truly humbling and we’re so grateful.

Thanks also to our university hosts at the Universities of Cape Coast and Ghana at Legon, and our home at Koforidua Technical University. Prof. LK Sam-Amoah, Dr. Francis Kumi, Dr Kofi Abeyi-Arthur, Dr. Henry Amankwah, Dr. Robert Sowah, Dr. Frank Dwomoh and Patricia – many thanks for your hospitality and support.

Thanks to our sponsors, Instil and Mallon Associates, for their material support.

We’re already making plans for next year! We’ll be hiring Ghanaian TAs, improving our instructor diversity, and expanding into another country. Please get in touch if you can help.

Finally, thanks to the 13 great folks who volunteered to come to Ghana and teach for Global Code. You’re an awesome team and I’m so proud to work with such wonderful friends!

Cheers

Sam
