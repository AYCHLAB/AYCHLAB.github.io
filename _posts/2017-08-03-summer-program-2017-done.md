School's out! We just completed our first summer programme at Koforidua Technical University in Eastern Ghana!

Our first summer programme was a roaring success:

  * 18 new Raspberry Pi stars ✅
  * 18 new GitHub coders ✅
  * 18 new Heroku heroes ✅
  * 18 new Pythonistas ✅

We got through a *lot* of material. In three short weeks we covered Linux, Python, git, Flask, Heroku, MQTT, electronics, web APIs and GPIO, and designed, built and presented a group project. 
*Phew*!

We’re officially on holiday, but until then – thanks and congratulations to our first Global Code cohort :)
