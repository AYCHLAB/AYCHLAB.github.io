Another year, another program - and this time, we're bigger and better than ever!

Global Code enters its third successive year at Five universities in Ghana (University of Ghana, Cape Coast University, Ho Technical University, Koforidua Technical University, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)).

This year we're playing host to more than 125 students from across Ghana, in a three week summer school that's packed with code, projects, and fun!

TWENTY-four visiting instructors are flying in to the country to work alongside eleven of our alumni from #GC2018.

We give every student a Raspberry Pi, and we teach Linux, Python, electronics, IoT and Web APIs, and finish with a week-long group project.

This year for the first time, fully HALF of our students are women, and we're celebrating this milestone with a full day of networking and fun activities for the #WomenOfGlobalCode on Saturday, 27th July.
