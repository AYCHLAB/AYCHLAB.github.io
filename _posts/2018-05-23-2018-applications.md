Great news – applications for the Global Code Summer Program 2018 are open!

We’ll teach Linux on the Raspberry Pi, Python, internet and IoT technologies, and electronics. After the program finishes, we’ll give you the Raspberry Pi as a gift.

It’s a three week program running five days a week, from July 2-20. Class is from 9am-12pm and 1pm-4pm.

This is our second year, and we’re growing! This year, as well as KTU, we’ll be running the program at Cape Coast University and the University of Ghana!

Applications are welcome from all students at KTU, UCC and UG who will start their final year of a programming course in September. Female applicants will be given free accommodation on-campus, thanks to our university hosts. To apply, simply fill in the form here: [https://goo.gl/hiJg9S](https://goo.gl/hiJg9S){:class="link"}
