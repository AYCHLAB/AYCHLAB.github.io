One week until the second Global Code Summer Program kicks off, and weâ€™re making our final preparations to make sure it all goes smoothly!

Local GC staffer Ibrahim has been working closely with out university contacts at Koforidua Tech, Cape Coast and UG Legon to prep our teaching areas and staff accommodation,


Electronics supplier and Ghanaian entrepreneur Isaac Sesi has been instrumental in our hardware testing,

Designer-on-the-ground Jemimah has been working on our social media plan,

Our teaching staff has been heads-down in planning and building teaching materials,

And most importantly of all, NINETY Ghanaian students have been confirming their attendance and preparing for the summer camp!
