Lamplighters is the invitation-only Global Code alumni program.

Started in 2018, the goal of Lamplighters is to identify the best and brightest of our Global Code students, and prepare them for jobs as brilliant software engineers.

Lamplighters are usually in their final year of university.

Each Lamplighter is assigned a personal mentor, someone who is themselves a seasoned engineer. They can expect regular, focussed mentoring sessions on topics from programming to presentation skills.

Every month, Lamplighters gather for an hour-long Google Hangout where an invited speaker presents a topic of interest. In the last year we've had industry experts talk about Machine Learning, cross-cultural work, functional programming, and "campus to corporate".

Lamplighters are closely involved in the curriculum and organisation of Global Code. Lamplighters are responsible for Global Code applications and, and often travel to campuses to make the initial GC student pitch.

Finally, Lamplighters have the opportunity to teach on Global Code, alongside the experts that we fly in each year. This is a unique opportunity to gain confidence, skill and experience, and a great way for them to give back to the programme.

Each teaching candidate is placed in a rigorous "train-the-trainer" class to prepare them for class.

Lamplighters is and always will be absolutely free to the student. If you'd like to know more, email <a href="mailto:sam@globalcode.org.uk">sam@globalcode.org.uk</a>.
